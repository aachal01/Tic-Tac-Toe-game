## My process

I tried to organize my folders structure similar to large scale projects. I find it as an easy method to find code pieces later.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I completed this challenge within 30,5 hours. I did it with as small html file as possible. Every component is rendered by JavaScript. I tried to create a folders structure similar to professional work. My code surely needs a refactore, but I wanted to go further, so I leave it as it is. I added tiny animations on modal elements.
